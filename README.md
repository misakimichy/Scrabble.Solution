## Description
Make a console application that takes a word and returns the Scrabble score for that word.
[Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15Ã—15 grid of squares

### Score Table
| Input | Score |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  | 1 |
| D, G | 2 |
| B, C, M, P | 3 |
| F, H, V, W, Y  | 4 |
| K | 5 |
| J, X | 8 |
| Q, Z  | 10 |

## Unit Testing
Receive the score of a number when the player enters the corresponding letter. For instance: 

| Spec  | input | Expected Output |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| User input a word | hello | 8 |
| User input a sentence | hello world | 17 |
| User input a number | 12345 | Invalid Input |
